# TASKS.md — Audwihr Roadmap & Sprint Board

## How This File Works

- **Roadmap** = phases, what each one delivers, migration triggers
- **Current Sprint** = the active branch and its specific tasks
- When a phase completes: check off tasks, move phase to Done, update CHANGELOG.md

---

## Current Sprint

**Branch:** `feature/phase-6-live-data`
**Goal:** Live Data Layer — UFCStats build-time scraper replaces all hand-authored fighter/event data

### Phase 6 — Live Data Layer
- [x] `scripts/fighter-seed.json` — 14 fighters with editorial fields + `ufcstats_url`
- [x] Discover and verify all 14 UFCStats fighter URLs (letter-browse + event page scraping)
- [x] `scripts/fetch-data.js` — UFCStats scraper (Node ESM, cheerio, native fetch)
  - [x] Fighter stats: record, age, height, reach, stance, SLpM, str_acc, sapm, str_def, TD/15, TD acc, TD def, sub/15
  - [x] Derived stats: streak, finishes (ko/sub/dec), losses_by, finish_rate
  - [x] Fight history: result, opponent, method, round, event, year
  - [x] Cache layer: `*.raw.json` per fighter, `--fresh` flag to bypass
  - [x] Validation: all required fields checked; non-zero exit on error in CI mode
  - [x] `--dry-run`, `--ci`, `--fresh` CLI flags
- [x] `npm run fetch-data` / `fetch-data:dry` / `fetch-data:fresh` / `prebuild` scripts
- [x] `cheerio ^1.2.0` devDependency
- [x] `.env.example` committed with `VITE_ODDS_API_KEY` placeholder
- [x] `*.raw.json` gitignored (scraper cache)
- [x] `src/data/fighters.js` generated with live data — 14/14 verified correct
- [x] ESLint clean (0 errors)
- [x] All 32 tests passing
- [x] Version bumped to v0.6.0, menu badge updated to `LIVE DATA`
- [ ] Commit and merge to `master`, tag v0.6.0

### ✅ Phase 5 — Fighter News Feed (v0.5.0) — complete
- [x] Design NEWS data model (id, date, fighter_id, category, headline, body, source, relevance)
- [x] `src/data/news.js` with full schema comment and 12 mock items
- [x] `src/screens/NewsScreen.jsx` — sorted news list with fighter links
- [x] Filter by category (fight / injury / camp / weigh-in / result)
- [x] Filter by fighter (select from roster)
- [x] `FighterName` links from news items → fighter profile
- [x] News CSS added to `app.css`
- [x] Menu badge updated to ACTIVE, version bumped to v0.5.0
- [x] `npm run build` passes — 66 kB gzipped
- [x] ESLint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] Smoke test: filters work, fighter link navigates correctly
- [x] Commit and merge to `master`, tag v0.5.0

## 🔲 Phase 7 — Live Odds Integration

**Branch:** `feature/phase-7-live-odds` (not yet cut)
**API:** The Odds API — `VITE_ODDS_API_KEY` placeholder already in `.env.example`
**Free tier:** 500 requests/month

### Planned tasks
- [ ] Cut branch `feature/phase-7-live-odds`
- [ ] `src/hooks/useOdds.js` — fetch + cache odds from The Odds API at session start
- [ ] Display live moneylines in TabMarket (supplement manual entry, not replace)
- [ ] Inject live lines into MarketsScreen alongside Polymarket/Kalshi/Novig rows
- [ ] Rate-limit guard: cache response in sessionStorage, one fetch per session
- [ ] Graceful degradation: if key missing or quota exceeded, fall back to manual entry silently
- [ ] `VITE_ODDS_API_KEY` documented in `.env.example`, validated at startup with warning if absent
- [ ] CSP: add `connect-src https://api.the-odds-api.com` to `netlify.toml` / `vercel.json`
- [ ] Write tests for `useOdds` hook (mock fetch, quota error, empty response)
- [ ] Lint, tests, build, merge, tag v0.7.0

---

## Backlog (Unscheduled)

### High value
- [ ] Matchup context engine — archetype-aware auto-warnings in compare view (e.g. "WRESTLER vs COUNTER STRIKER — takedown threat flagged")
- [ ] Fighter portrait images — hosting solution TBD (Cloudinary / repo assets)
- [ ] Add more fighters — expand to full top-15 per division
- [ ] Fighter search by stat range (e.g. "TD def > 80%", "SLpM > 5")

### Medium value
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout — sidebar collapses to bottom nav on narrow viewports
- [ ] Export trade notes as PDF or markdown
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle — CSS variable swap, all colors already tokenized

### Low / nice-to-have
- [ ] Keyboard navigation — arrow keys in sidebar, tab key across screens
- [ ] Visual reskin pass — final art direction, consider typographic hierarchy update
- [ ] Sound design pass — click feedback, confirmation sounds (user opt-in only)
