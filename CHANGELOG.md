All notable changes to this project. Format: [version] — date — description.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `NewsScreen` — fighter news feed with category and fighter filters
- `src/data/news.js` — 12 mock news items across injury, camp, fight booking, weigh-in, and result categories
- Category filter chips (ALL / FIGHT / INJURY / CAMP / WEIGH-IN / RESULT) with color-coded badges
- Fighter filter dropdown (populated from news roster)
- Relevance signal per item: HIGH (amber) / MEDIUM (blue) / LOW (dim) — trading signal strength
- `FighterName` links from news items navigate directly to fighter profile
- All 5 menu items now ACTIVE — `ComingSoon` screen no longer used
- News CSS added to `app.css`
- Menu version bumped to v0.5.0

### Code Quality
- Tab components (`TabOverview`, `TabStriking`, `TabGrappling`, `TabPhysical`, `TabHistory`, `TabMarket`) — renamed single-letter prop `f` → `fighter` at API level (CLAUDE.md compliance)
- Static constants extracted from component bodies to module scope: `WEIGHT_FILTERS` (FighterScreen), `SORT_LABELS` + `PLATFORMS` (MarketsScreen), `MENU_ITEMS` (MenuScreen)
- Pure helper functions extracted to module scope with `today` parameter: `fmtDate`, `isPast`, `daysUntil`, `countdown` (CalendarScreen); `fmtVolume`, `computeArb`, `totalVolume`, `daysUntil`, `countdown`, `countdownColor` (MarketsScreen)
- `ARCH_COLORS` and `MOD_COLORS` now reference CSS variables (`var(--blue)`, `var(--green)`, etc.) — eliminates hardcoded hex from constants; `--dark-red` added to design system for BRAWLER / FRONT-RUNNER
- Fixed: line movement arrow in `TabMarket` now correctly shows `▼` for downward moves (was always `▲`)
- Fixed: division-by-zero guard added to sub win rate in `TabGrappling`
- Fixed: `isNaN` guard added to public bet % check in `TabMarket` (CLAUDE.md input validation pattern)
- Fixed: `let lastCat` render mutation in `CompareScreen` replaced with pure index comparison (`i === 0 || rows[i-1].cat !== r.cat`) — Strict Mode safe

## [Unreleased] — Phase 3 + Phase 3a

### Added — Phase 3a (Vite Migration)
